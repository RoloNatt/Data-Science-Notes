## Aspects of Data Science
- To extract knowledge from data - understand data and find relationships between them
- Uses Statistics and Probability
- Produce actionable insights
- Should be able to operate on both structured and unstructured data


## Related Fields
Databases - how to store data
Big Data - how to store large data in a distributed manner and process it efficiently
Machine Learning - developing models from data to predict the desired outcome
Artificial Intelligence - building high-complexity models that mimic human thought processes
Visualization - creating useful visualizations to make sense of the data and draw conclusions


## Steps of Data Journey
- Collecting Data
- Storing Data 
- Processing Data
- Visualization Data
- Training a Predictive Model - Machine Learning

## Types of Data & Where to get it
Structured
- IoT
- Surveys
- Analysis of behavior

Unstructured
- Text
- Images & Videos
- Logs

Semi-structured
- Social network graphs
- Group dynamics data by building a graph of people taking pics together

## Assignment

Problems in different domains & how we can improve using Data Science

1. Problem Domain: Education
- Problem: Improve learning and scores of students in schools
- Which data to collect: student name, student gender, student age, test scores, subject, date of test, time of test, teacher name, teacher qualifications 
- How to store data:
- Which insights/decisions we can make: does student age and gender affect in scores, does date and time affect scores (near holidays/ mid-week/ early morning/ after lunch), do teachers with a B.Ed degree affect students' scores

2. Problem Domain: Employee Productivity
- Problem: Improve the productivity of the people going to office
- Which data to collect: home distance from office, mode of travel, working hours, is the employee on time or late, how much % of given work is completed (weekly), office/remote, no. of meetings
- How to store data:
- Which insights/decisions we can make: does travel mode/distance affect productivity? (coz tired?), remote or work from office - does it affect productivity?

3. Problem Domain: Gaming
- Problem: 
- Which data to collect: 
- How to store data:
- Which insights/decisions we can make:
