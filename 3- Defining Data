## How Data is Described

Raw data - initial state and has not been analyzed or organized.

### Quantitative Data
- numerical observations
- can be analyzed, measured and used mathematically
- Eg: country's population, person's height, company's quarterly earnings

### Qualitative Data / Categorical data
- cannot be measured objectively
- generally various formats of subjective data that captures the quality of something, such as a product or process
- sometimes, qualitative data is numerical and wouldn't be typically used mathematically, like phone numbers or timestamps

### Structured Data
- organized into rows and columns
- Eg: spreadsheets, relational databases, phone numbers, bank statements

### Unstructured Data
- cannot be categorized into rows and columns
- easier to add new information
- Eg: text files, text messages, video files

### Semi-structured Data
- doesn't typically conform to a format of rows and columns but is organized in a way that is considered structured and may follow a fixed format or set of rules
- Eg: HTML, CSV files, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
