## Probability & Random Variables

Probability = no. of possible outcomes / total no. of outcomes

Eg: Rolling a dice
Sample space : set of numbers from 1 to 6
Probability of random variable, P(X=2) = 1/6    here, 2 is a random variable -> it is discrete

Discrete: countable sample space  -> eg: rolling a dice
Continuous: sample space is a range of real numbers, or a whole set of real numbers   -> time when the bus arrives

## Probability Distribution

difficult to describe the probability distribution of a continuous variable

probability density function p(x)

## Mean, Variance and Standard Deviation

#### Mean

mean (arithmetic avg) = (x1, x2, ... xn)/n

when sample increases, i.e., n→∞,

mean (expectation), ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15999442/220879352-a98b3b36-277f-403d-a996-25bbd2efaa6f.png)             (values {x1, x2, ..., xN} and corresponding probabilities p1, p2, ..., pN)

#### Variance 
how far the values are spread

variance, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15999442/220879412-29ac57f6-b2f2-4f17-b3b0-296a4fe62f1b.png)         (μ = mean of the sequence)

σ   -> standard deviation
σ^2 -> variance

## Mode, Median and Quartiles

when there are a few extreme values that are completely out of range, they can affect the mean

Median -> a value such that half of data points are lower than it, and another half - higher

Quartiles
- First quartile, Q1, is a value, such that 25% of the data fall below it
- Third quartile, Q3, is a value that 75% of the data fall below it

Mode -> good "typical" value -> value that appears the most frequently
